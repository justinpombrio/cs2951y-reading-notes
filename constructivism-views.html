<h2>Prior Knowledge</h2>

<p>Constructivists say:
"We learn by combining prior knowledge with new experience."</p>

<p>I don't doubt this, and the explanations/theories students come up
with for mystery languages is almost certainly influenced by their
prior knowledge.</p>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p>The Mystery Language approach <em>trains</em> students to employ a
knowledge-as-theory aprroach to explain programming languages.
No assumptions about the <em>mechanisms</em> of learning, though.</p>

<h2>Abstraction</h2>

<p>See <em>specific PL knowledge</em> below. With luck, students will construct
abstractions (of whatever sort) of different language features.</p>

<h2>Transfer</h2>

<p>There are two things we hope to transfer:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Specific PL knowledge</em>, such as static vs. dynamic scope.
Hopefully, seeing these features in practice (as the end-user of a
language) will make them easier to recognize in the future than
seeing them in theory, or seeing how they are implemented (via the
standard interpreter-driven approach).</li>
<li><em>The Skill of exploring languages</em>, which is not normally taught in
any class. It is very important that this skill transfer; otherwise
the Mystery Language approach is moot. Fortunately, students <em>did</em>
transfer this skill to other languages in their final projects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assesment</h2>

<p>Two parts to assesment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you distinguish the variants? Completely objective.</li>
<li>How good is your explanation/theory? This part might be considered
constructivist. There is no single right answer: instead we check
that a student's answer is consistent with and descriptive of their
classifier, and that they didn't miss anything "big".  Students can
and did construct different correct explanations for the same
language (e.g. mutable structs: copying vs. analogy with variable
aliasing).</li>
</ul>

<p>That is: we check that their explanation is <em>true</em>, and relatively
complete.</p>
