<h1>Reading Notes for Brown CS 2951y:<br/>
(Formal Semantics & Notational Machines)</h1>

<p><a href="reactions.html">Class-ly reactions are here</a></p>

<h1>Class Notes</h1>

<p><strong>Mental model:</strong> student's beliefs</p>

<p><strong>Notational machine:</strong> a model of a language meant to aid students</p>

<p><strong>Concept inventory:</strong> a set of misconceptions on a topic, as well as
  the correct understanding, that cover all of the common
  understandings that students come to. Can then tell which a student
  has via multiple-choice questions.</p>

<p><strong>Constructivism:</strong> "learning by doing" / "discovery learning".
From this perspective, not having a curriculum when teaching could be
good.</p>

<h2>Qualify Your Quantifiers...Or, Exactly Who All Is CS4?</h2>

<p>Do not conflate "CS for all students" with "CS in all schools".
CS for all students requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>that courses not be opt-in, or you lose equal representation, and</li>
<li>support for the disabled, and of course</li>
<li>enough teachers to teach every student.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is <em>much</em> harder than just adding after-school clubs.</p>

<h2>Learner-Centered Design of Computing Education</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1: Computing for Everyone</h3>

<p><strong>Computing:</strong> broader than computer science.</p>

<p><strong>Computational Thinking:</strong> the thought process involved in formulating
 problems and their solutions so that the solutions are represented in
 a form that can be effectively carried out by an
 information-processing agent.</p>

<p>Reasons we should teach CS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jobs (most common citatation).</li>
<li>We live in a world filled with software.</li>
<li>Computational thinking.</li>
<li>Computational literacy (???).</li>
<li>Productivity (e.g. graphic designers, e.g. historians plotting
peoples' movement)</li>
<li>Broadening representation (e.g. currently AP CS 20% female)</li>
</ul>

<p>Perspectives of Teachers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apprenticeship</strong> (experience, practice, assignments)</li>
<li><strong>Transmission</strong> (content)</li>
<li><strong>Developmental</strong> (differing needs &amp; starting knowledge)</li>
</ul>

<p>How to teach CS to all students:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the US, CS is classified as <em>vocational</em>, not <em>STEM</em>. Adds
administrative challanges (e.g., separate, may not count for credit
in some contexts).</li>
<li>Consider that we're currently only teaching the top students.</li>
<li><strong>learner-centered design</strong>: tailor teaching to what students want
to learn; to discover this you must do studies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 2: Measuring CS Knowledge</h3>

<p>Studies show: students are <em>really bad</em> at programming
(e.g. rainfall, calculator, clock, FCS1).</p>

<p>Learning happens by <strong>assimilation</strong>: adding to existing perspective,
and <strong>accomodation</strong>: updating perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge transfer</strong>: being able to apply knowledge in a domain
  different from the one you learned it in.</p>

<p>Learning to program is difficult because:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no person in the machine to interpret what you meant</li>
<li>What's happening is invisible</li>
<li>Experts have blinds spots of "obvious" knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why do students choose to program?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Situated Learning</strong>: students choose topics whose communities they
wish to join.</li>
<li><strong>Expectancy-Value Theory</strong>: students choose topics they think would
provide utility and that they could succeed at. (See also
complicated <strong>Eccles</strong> model.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 3: Using programming to Learn</h3>

<p>We've largely failed at finding or imparting knowledge transfer into
or out of computing education. We only really know how to impart it
by teaching it directly in the transfer domain.</p>

<p>Some successes in teaching programming <em>and</em> other skills together.
Guzdial concludes that you should generally expect to teach only
enough programming for the other subject you're targetting, and expect
students to learn the other subject well, but not necessarily learn
much programming.</p>

<p>Some programming methods/environments discuessed:
LOGO, Smalltalk, ISDP, Emile, Bootstrap, Boxer.</p>

<h2>Camels and Humps: a Retraction</h2>

<p>"I continue to believe, however, that Dehnadi had uncovered the first
evidence of an important phenomenon in programming learners. Later
research seems to confirm that belief."</p>

<p><strong>Disagreement:</strong> Is it supposed to be surprising that a test that
  (indirectly) measures programming aptitude predicts performance in a
  programming class?</p>

<p>"That document was very misleading and, because web documents persist,
it continues to mislead to this day."</p>

<p><strong>Disagreement:</strong> That's because it's <em>hosted</em> on Dehnadi's <em>website</em>,
  which doesn't mention the <em>retraction</em>.</p>

<h2>Markman: Knowledge Representation (Intro)</h2>

<p>Gives a <em>beautiful</em> proof that we're better at concrete reasoning than
abstract.</p>

<p><strong>Task one:</strong> you have a deck of cards with letters on one
side and numbers on the other. You see (one side of) four of the
cards. You'd like to check a rule, that if a card has a vowel on one
side then it has an odd number on the other. Which cards do you need
to check?</p>

<pre><code>A 7 J 4
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Task two:</strong> you need to verify that a bar is correctly only giving
beer to customers over 21. Which people do you need to check?</p>

<pre><code>Person 1: you know to be 18
Person 2: you know to be 22
Person 3: holding a beer
Person 4: drinking club soda
</code></pre>

<p>My intuition tells me the answer to task two, but throws up its hands
at task one.</p>
