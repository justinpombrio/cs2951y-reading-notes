<h1>Reading Notes for Brown CS 2951y:<br/>
(Formal Semantics & Notational Machines)</h1>

(Justin Pombrio)


### Qualify Your Quantifiers...Or, Exactly Who All Is CS4?

Do not conflate "CS for all students" with "CS in all schools".
CS for all students requires:

- that courses not be opt-in, or you lose equal representation, and
- support for the disabled, and of course
- enough teachers to teach every student.  This is *much* harder than
just adding after-school clubs.
