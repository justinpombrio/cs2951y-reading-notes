<h1>Class-ly Reactions<br/>
(Interest, surprise, disagreement)</h1>

(Justin Pombrio)

[(Class notes are here.)](README.html)

# Day 1

### A Surprise

In the US, CS is classified as *vocational*, not *STEM*.

### A Captivation

The three perspectives.

### A Disagreement

Says that intro CS is harder than intro math or an intro science.
The argument is that students come in with (at least some) real-life
knowledge that applies. But students have no experience with
unambiguous languages.

However, math is like that, except that you don't have a computer to
check your work.

### A Question

Rainfall problem: how do results differ when students test their
program vs. not?

### A Confusion

*Computational Literacy* (1.2.4). This section seems to mix up:

- The internet, which is indeed akin to the printing press
- Word processing and such
- Computational literacy

"We see coding as a new way for people to organize, express, and share
their ideas."

What exactly does this sharing look like? It's relevant for
scientists, but that was already covered in "computational thinking".
Is it people programming in spreadsheets that they share? What do
actual example look like?

> animated greeting cards
> spreadsheet formulas
> tweaking/appreciating websites
> musicians using MaxMSP

### A Confusion

Pg. 37: What is "process" here? Earlier in the book, it was *defined*
as being what a program does, but here it's supposed to be broader
than CS.

### A Surprise

Apparently LOGO taught poorly. I'm curious to see the studies that
killed it, what the language's aims were and what the results were.
(My guess: the aims presented for LOGO were way out of whack with what
one could reasonably expect to learn from the language.)

# Day 2

### A Question

**Common Goal** of intro CS: students should be "capable of developing a
(small) program which solves a problem that has been expressed vaguely
in non-programming terms."

Is the *common goal* realistic?

### A Captivation

I saw a confusion about probability in a Nautilus article today that I
only know how to explain if the author (a physicist) believes that the
probability of an event is independent of your knowledge. This is a
*really* fundamental mistake. (It's also why there's a picture of a
pipe on my wall.) Are there misconceptions like this that experienced
computer scientists live with?

And intro CS students seem to have just about every possible
misconception. Does "learning" consist of picking a random hypothesis
consistent with the evidence and believing it until it's unequivocally
disproven?

(For curiosity, the article is
[here](http://cosmos.nautil.us/feature/120/the-crisis-of-the-multiverse);
the "sleeper" argument begins with "The issue came into focus via..."
and ends at "The fact that two logical lines of argument yield
contradictory answers tells us that the problem is not well-defined."
(they don't).)
