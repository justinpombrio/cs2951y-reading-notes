<h1>Reading Notes for Brown CS 2951y:<br/>
(Formal Semantics & Notational Machines)</h1>

<h1>Class Notes</h1>

<p><strong>Mental model:</strong> student's beliefs</p>

<p><strong>Notational machine:</strong> a model of a language meant to aid students</p>

<p><strong>Concept inventory:</strong> a set of misconceptions on a topic, as well as
  the correct understanding, that cover all of the common
  understandings that students come to. Can then tell which a student
  has via multiple-choice questions.</p>

<p><strong>Constructivism:</strong> "learning by doing" / "discovery learning".
From this perspective, not having a curriculum when teaching could be
good.</p>

<h1>Reading Notes</h1>

<h2>Qualify Your Quantifiers...Or, Exactly Who All Is CS4?</h2>

<p>Do not conflate "CS for all students" with "CS in all schools".
CS for all students requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>that courses not be opt-in, or you lose equal representation, and</li>
<li>support for the disabled, and of course</li>
<li>enough teachers to teach every student.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is <em>much</em> harder than just adding after-school clubs.</p>

<h2>Learner-Centered Design of Computing Education</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1: Computing for Everyone</h3>

<p><strong>Computing:</strong> broader than computer science.</p>

<p><strong>Computational Thinking:</strong> the thought process involved in formulating
 problems and their solutions so that the solutions are represented in
 a form that can be effectively carried out by an
 information-processing agent.</p>

<p>Reasons we should teach CS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jobs (most common citatation).</li>
<li>We live in a world filled with software.</li>
<li>Computational thinking.</li>
<li>Computational literacy (???).</li>
<li>Productivity (e.g. graphic designers, e.g. historians plotting
peoples' movement)</li>
<li>Broadening representation (e.g. currently AP CS 20% female)</li>
</ul>

<p>Perspectives of Teachers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apprenticeship</strong> (experience, practice, assignments)</li>
<li><strong>Transmission</strong> (content)</li>
<li><strong>Developmental</strong> (differing needs &amp; starting knowledge)</li>
</ul>

<p>How to teach CS to all students:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the US, CS is classified as <em>vocational</em>, not <em>STEM</em>. Adds
administrative challanges (e.g., separate, may not count for credit
in some contexts).</li>
<li>Consider that we're currently only teaching the top students.</li>
<li><strong>learner-centered design</strong>: tailor teaching to what students want
to learn; to discover this you must do studies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 2: Measuring CS Knowledge</h3>

<p>Studies show: students are <em>really bad</em> at programming
(e.g. rainfall, calculator, clock, FCS1).</p>

<p>Learning happens by <strong>assimilation</strong>: adding to existing perspective,
and <strong>accomodation</strong>: updating perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge transfer</strong>: being able to apply knowledge in a domain
  different from the one you learned it in.</p>

<p>Learning to program is difficult because:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no person in the machine to interpret what you meant</li>
<li>What's happening is invisible</li>
<li>Experts have blinds spots of "obvious" knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why do students choose to program?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Situated Learning</strong>: students choose topics whose communities they
wish to join.</li>
<li><strong>Expectancy-Value Theory</strong>: students choose topics they think would
provide utility and that they could succeed at. (See also
complicated <strong>Eccles</strong> model.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 3: Using programming to Learn</h3>

<p>We've largely failed at finding or imparting knowledge transfer into
or out of computing education. We only really know how to impart it
by teaching it directly in the transfer domain.</p>

<p>Some successes in teaching programming <em>and</em> other skills together.
Guzdial concludes that you should generally expect to teach only
enough programming for the other subject you're targetting, and expect
students to learn the other subject well, but not necessarily learn
much programming.</p>

<p>Some programming methods/environments discuessed:
LOGO, Smalltalk, ISDP, Emile, Bootstrap, Boxer.</p>

<h2>Sorva: VPS in Introductory Programming Education</h2>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p><strong>Common Goal</strong> of intro CS: students should be "capable of developing a
(small) program which solves a problem that has been expressed vaguely
in non-programming terms."</p>

<h4>Bloom Taxonomy</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recall, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it meaningful? Yes: it has been validated, even in the context of
CS ed (Whalley et. al 2006). Untrained academics apply it
inconsistently, however.</p>

<p>The Bloom Taxonomy suggests that the <em>common goal</em> is demanding.</p>

<h4>SOLO Taxonomy</h4>

<p>Unlike Bloom, SOLO aims to categorize student <em>responses</em>, rather than
teacher <em>questions</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prestructural, Unistructural, Multistructural, Relational, Extended
Abstract</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, from the original publication:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>incoherent, linear, conventional, integrated, and metaphoric</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought these categories sounded hopelessly vague, until they were
described in the context of a programming question (describe how this
code works):</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Prestructural</em>: Lacks knowledge to answer the question (confused response)</li>
<li><em>Unistructural</em>: Describes one part of the code</li>
<li><em>Multistructural</em>: Line-by-line description</li>
<li><em>Relational</em>: Summary of the code w.r.t. its purpose</li>
</ol>

<p>Like Bloom, SOLO suggests that intro CS has high expectations.</p>

<p>Conclusion: CS educators may be systematically underestimating the
difficulty of what they hope students will learn.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is the <em>common goal</em> realistic?</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>Many students are not learning to write programs in CS1. Many are not
even learning to <em>trace</em> programs (given a program, describe what
happens as it runs).</p>

<p>Coding is hard, so what's a good learning path?</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn to read before learning to write? Maybe not: Simon
et. al 2009.</li>
<li>Bloom's taxonomy? Predicts <em>difficulty</em>, but does not give a
<em>learning path</em>.</li>
<li><em>Trace</em> and <em>explain</em> first? This is the hypothesis of BRACElet.
They give evidence that <em>basic</em> tracing and explanation are required
for <em>basic</em> program writing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some misconceptions (there's a great list on page 359 (the 367th page)):</p>

<ul>
<li>Superbug: give intentionality to the machine</li>
<li>Conflate "let" with mathematical "="</li>
<li>Confusions with variable initialization</li>
<li>Confusions with recursion</li>
<li>OOP (many)</li>
</ul>
